## Project Goal:
<ul>
 <li>Create an Instagram home page copy using HTML5 and CSS3
<ul>

## Work flow:

<p>I created various HTML elements and used CSS to arrange these elments on the page, then i styled them as best I could to
mimic the ones on the actual instagram website. I ran into a few issues with placing elements around the page from using
specific borders and padding that would unintentionally move other elements if certain conditions were met. I overcame this by
changing the spacing to be percentage based so the spacing would be uniform no matter the size of the page.</p>
