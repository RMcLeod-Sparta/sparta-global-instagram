# Instagram Page

## Work Order
- I was tasked with replicating the Instagram home page using HTML and CSS.
- Created folder with index and style and opened them in atom.
- Set up a HTML structure and added various elements to the body.
- Ordered the elements to mimic to actual Instagram page as best I could.
- Created a GitHub repository and linked it with my Instagram project
- Made the initial commit on the dev branch.
  - *At this point I was introduced to responsiveness in HTML and realised my project was poorly optimised for a scaling webpage.*
- Reworked the necessary elements into a cohesive structure.
- Applied my responsiveness knowledge to make it so the page changes appropriately when I rescale it.
- Pushed the changes I have made to GitHub for evaluation.
